## Getting Started

**Note: due to an existing problem, make sure that you're opening vscode from the [command-line](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac), at the root of your project**!

### Recommended Syntax Themes

Although syntax highlighting should display well in most themes we recommend and test with the following:

- [Atom One Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=freebroccolo.theme-atom-one-dark)
- Dark+ (default theme)
- [Dracula](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula)
- [Flatland Monokai](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gerane.Theme-FlatlandMonokai)
- [Oceanic Next](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.theme-oceanicnext)

### Reason Configuration

- [Reason](http://reasonml.github.io/guide/editor-tools/global-installation#recommended-through-npmyarn)

Nothing is required apart from the standard Reason install steps linked above. The Reason installation steps also installs Merlin for you.

### Merlin Configuration

**Configured for you already if you've installed Reason above & plan to use it for JS compilation. Skip this step.**

This extension relies heavily on [merlin](https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin) so you will
need to have your project set up for that in order to enable completion and hover info. See the
Merlin [wiki](https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin/wiki/project-configuration) for details on
how to do that. Basically you need to have a `.merlin` file in your project root which lists the
source directories, libraries, and extensions used.

## Advanced Features

### Case splitting

For the examples below, `<cursor>` represents the position of the current VS Code editor cursor.

#### Introducing a `switch`

In order to introduce a `switch`, execute the following steps:

1. select an identifier or move the cursor anywhere within its word range (as below)
2. open the palette (⇧⌘P) and run `Reason: case split` (typing `case` should pull it up)

##### Before
```
let foo (arg: list 'a) => a<cursor>rg;
```

##### After
```
let foo (arg: list 'a) => switch arg {
  | [] => failwith "<case>"
  | [_, ..._] => failwith "<case>"
};
```

#### Nesting `switch` expressions

The `switch` introduction functionality works with nested `switch` expressions:

##### Before
```
let foo (arg: list 'a) => switch arg {
  | [] => failwith "<case>"
  | [_, ...xs] => x<cursor>s
};
```

##### After
```
let foo (arg: list 'a) => switch arg {
  | [] => failwith "<case>"
  | [_, ...xs] => switch xs {
    | [] => failwith "<case>"
    | [_, ..._] => failwith "<case>"
  }
};
```

#### Splitting a pattern without introducing a `switch`

The case split feature can be used to split an existing pattern further:

##### Before
```
let foo (arg: list 'a) => switch arg {
  | [] => failwith "<case>"
  | [x, ...x<cursor>s] => failwith "<case>"
};
```

##### After
```
let foo (arg: list 'a) => switch arg {
  | [] => failwith "<case>"
  | [_] | [_, _, ..._] => failwith "<case>"
};
```
